* Today's work

** Auto-updater

   The auto-updater had some bugs and we're still working on it.
   Expected release for tomorrow.

** Atomic operations

   This is going to be a long-term work

** Hashrate data collection

   We're going to collect the hashrate data on each miner to know the
   approximated hashrate of the network. The work on that is almost
   finished, and will be deployed with the auto-updater.

* What's to come

** Future plans
