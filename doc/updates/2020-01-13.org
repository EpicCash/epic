* Today's work

** Mobile app

   The app is basically at the point of release, we just need to setup
   the safe machine to build and sign the APK, so it will be available
   at some point tomorrow. We still don't know how hard it will be to
   get it on the Play Store and F-Droid.

** Floonet

   We're recreating the servers of the floonet. Probably the work will
   be done by tomorrow as well.

* What's to come
