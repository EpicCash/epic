** Icemining's error

   Issues:
   - https://gitlab.com/epiccash/epicwallet/issues/4
   - https://gitlab.com/epiccash/epicwallet/issues/10
   - https://gitlab.com/epiccash/epicwallet/issues/16

   We fixed all of the Epic Wallet tests and enabled the Continuous
   Integration for it. The plan was that icemining's error would be
   covered by the testing scenarios.

   They weren't. We're modifying the plan in multiple fronts now:

   1. We've traced the error to a wrong request in the Epic Server API
      (~/v1/pool/push~), which is implemented [[file:../..//api/src/handlers/pool_api.rs::62][here]] We're debugging
      this method
   2. We're creating a test case for this section of communication in
      the wallet.
   3. We're manually calling this API with curl


* What's to come

** Release

   We'll immediately make a release for the wallet when icemining's
   error is fixed. We'll call it 2.2.3. As you suggested, we're going
   to first make a release candidate (2.2.3rc1) before fully
   committing to 2.2.3.


** Other work

   - Wallet proxying
     - https://gitlab.com/epiccash/epicwallet/issues/11

   Will wait for icemining's error.
