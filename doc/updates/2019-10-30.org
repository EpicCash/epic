* Today's work

** Auto-updater

   The auto-updater had some bugs and we're still working on it.

** Atomic operations

   We want to increase the level of atomicity in the system, so we're
   working on adding transactions to all important operations in the system.

** Telemetry

   We're discussing the possibility of collecting the hashrate data
   (and absolutely nothing else) from the active miners in the
   network. We're developing a server that will only collect that.
   This is still under discussion.

* What's to come

** Future plans
