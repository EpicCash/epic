* Today's work

** Auto-updater

   We're doing the installer for Windows and Debian in order to
   release the auto-updater, we're sorry about the delay.

** Hashrate data collection

   The hashrate data collection work is complete and is waiting for
   the auto-updater to be released.

   We want to make it clear that you'll be able to opt-out from the
   data collection. But we want to make it even more clear that we
   will not collect any sort of personal data, all we're collecting is
   the hashrate, we won't even identify the owner of each hashrate.
   Once our work is done, we'll publish it in GitLab so everyone can
   be sure that we aren't collecting any more data.

* What's to come

** Future plans
