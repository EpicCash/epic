* Today's work

** Auto-updater

   We had improvements on the auto-updater tool, a release is expected
   by next week.

** Better difficulty adjustment

   As a clarification from the last update: we're still discussing how
   this would be done. We do not wish to reset the chain or break
   consensus, for now the discussion of difficulty adjustment is just
   a discussion.

** Atomic operations

   We want to increase the level of atomicity in the system, so we're
   working on adding transactions to all important operations in the system.

* What's to come

** Future plans
