#+TITLE: Epic Testnet
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Introduction

This document describes how to run each of the elements of the testnet
for the Epic blockchain.

There are three cases that you can do with testnet. 
- [[#server][Running only the server]].
- [[#wallet_server][Running the server and the wallet.]]
- [[#miner_wallet_server][Running the server, the wallet and the miner]].

If you want to just have a copy of the chain or help the propagation
of the blocks in the network, all you need is to run the server.

If you want to make transactions such as payments or receiving
payments, you need to run the epic server and the epic wallet.

If you want to produce new blocks and with that gain rewards (both new
coins and transactions fees), you will need to run the epic server
with an epic wallet listening to it and an epic miner.

* Supported Platforms

For now, these are the supported platforms:

- Linux x86_64 [epic + mining + wallet + development].
  - We have a dpkg for Ubuntu
- MacOS (no package yet)

We plan to add support for Windows soon.

* Requirements
   
    #+begin_src shell
      sudo apt install libncurses5 libncursesw5 zlib1g openssl
    #+end_src

** LibRandomX

Before installing the epic components (server, wallet, miner), we need
to install the libRandomX dependency. The following steps explain how
to install this dependency:

1. Download the latest version of the [[https://epiccash.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/packages/librandomx_1.0.0-2_amd64.deb][librandomx]]. Checksum SHA256:
   95294d5ebe3ac663490caa2f51fab6f14f00043f6f2c015fc1ab07a73e4407bf

2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the
   .deb file and execute the following command changing the argument
   <your-librandomX.deb> to the name of your downloaded file:

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo dpkg -i <your-librandomX.deb>
    #+end_src
#+ATTR_HTML: :id server
* Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: server
  :END:

The epic server is a node in the network that validates, propagates
and sometimes produces new blocks (for the latter, you need a miner),
which is a basically a collection of processed transactions. In this
section we explain how to install and setup your epic server.

** Installation

The following steps explain how to install and run the epic server:

1. Download the latest version of the [[https://epiccash.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/packages/epic_1.0.3-3_amd64.deb][epic server]]. Checksum SHA256:
   2f32eeeb35c465c88c7e35e7ebf95db3448dfd8020cbb5e653674158f882d338

2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the
   .deb file and execute the following command changing the argument
   <your-epic-server.deb> to the name of your downloaded file:

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo dpkg -i <your-epic-server.deb>
    #+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :id run_epic
** Running the Epic Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: run_epic
  :END:
After you finished the installation, you can run it by executing the
following command in the terminal:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic
    #+end_src

*If you are running the epic server for the first time, it will use*
*its [[#epic_config_default][default configuration]]. If you want to save all epic server data*
*in a custom directory check the section [[#epic_config_custom][Configuring a Custom
 Directory.]]*

If you executed the epic server in Text-User-Interface mode (TUI), you
should see a screen like this:

#+CAPTION: Epic server in TUI mode 
#+NAME:   fig:epic-miner
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50% 
[[./images/epic-server.png]]

Press the key *Tab* or the *Arrows* keys to change windows inside the epic
server. Press the key *Enter* to select an item. Press the key *Q* to
quit the epic server.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id run_config_default
** Configuring your Epic node
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: epic_config_default
  :END:

By default, the epic server keeps all of its configuration files and
data in the ~~/.epic~ directory under your user home. The main server
configuration file can be found in the file
~~/.epic/main/epic-server.toml~. This file is fully documented and
contains many configuration options for your Epic server. Leaving
these values at their defaults should work for most people who simply
want to run a node.
#+ATTR_HTML: :id epic_config_custom
*** Configuring a Custom Directory
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: epic_config_custom
  :END:

You can also keep Epic's data and configuration files in a custom
directory. In the terminal, navigate to the directory in which you
want Epic to store its files and run:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic server config
    #+end_src
    
This will create an ~epic-server.toml~ file in the current directory
that is configured to place its data files in the same
directory. *The* *epic command will always check the current directory
for an* *~epic-server.toml~ file, and if one is found it will use it
instead of* *~~/.epic/main/epic-server.toml~.* Therefore, we always
have to navigate to the custom directory before running the
epic server.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id wallet_server
* Wallet + Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: wallet_server
  :END:

The epic wallet is quite literally your wallet. It's where your
account's balance is stored and where you spend and receive money.

*To run the epic-wallet you also need an epic server running*. The
wallet request transactions from the epic server. The epic server is
responsible for propagating and receiving the transactions.

Instruction of how to run the epic server can be found on [[#run_epic][Running the
Epic Server]].

** Installation
The following steps explain how to install and run the epic-wallet:

1. Download the latest version of the [[https://epiccash.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/packages/epic-wallet_1.0.2-1_amd64.deb][epic wallet]]. Checksum SHA256:
   94e4ec665a0ba7b6374af46c9ae50388b8fc900ae104851b2f336e96f0a044c9

2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the directory where you
   downloaded the .deb file and execute the following command changing
   the argument <your-epic-wallet.deb> to the name of your downloaded
   file:

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo dpkg -i <your-epic-wallet.deb>
    #+end_src

#+ATTR_HTML: :id init_wallet
** Initialize the Wallet
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: init_wallet
  :END:    
Before you can use the Epic wallet, it must be initialized. This
process will initialize your wallet's database and create your secret
master seed file. For this, we need to run the following command in
the terminal:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-wallet init
    #+end_src
    
You will then be prompted to enter a password. This password will be
used to encrypt your master seed file, and you will need to provide
this password every time you want to use your wallet. The output
should be something like this:

    #+begin_src shell
      File /home/yeastplume/.epic/main/epic-wallet.toml configured and created
      Please enter a password for your new wallet
      Password: 
      Confirm Password: 
    #+end_src

Once this is done, your wallet seed file will be generated, and you
will be given a 24 word recovery phrase which you can use to recover
your wallet if you lose your seed file or forget the password. Write
this phrase down using a pen and paper and keep it somewhere safe,
since anyone who has this phrase can control all of your funds:

Your wallet's configuration file is located at
~~/.epic/main/epic-wallet.toml~. You can change the default node address,
default listener ports and many more options by editing this file.

** Initializing from a Custom Directory

You can also keep epic wallet's data and configuration files in a
custom directory. In the terminal, navigate to the directory in which
you want Epic to store its files and run:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-wallet init -h
    #+end_src
    
This will create an ~epic-wallet.toml~ file in the current directory that
is configured to place its data files in the same directory. The
epic-wallet command will always check the current directory for a
~epic-wallet.toml~ file, and if one is found it will use it instead of
~~/.epic/main/epic-wallet.toml~.
#+ATTR_HTML: :id run_wallet
** Running the wallet API
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: run_wallet
  :END:
Once you have initialized the wallet, we need to execute it in listen
mode to be able to make transactions. With your [[#run_epic][epic server running]],
to execute the epic-wallet in listen mode, run the following command
in a new terminal window:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-wallet -e listen
    #+end_src

You will be prompted to enter your wallet password. After you have
inserted it, the wallet will start to listen for requests.

** Check the wallet balance

To check your contents of your wallet, use the info command:

 #+begin_src shell
   epic-wallet info
 #+end_src

You should see an output like this:

 #+begin_src shell 
   ____ Wallet Summary Info - Account 'default' as of height 13833 ____

   Total                            | 60.482000000
   Immature Coinbase (< 1440)       | 60.030000000
   Awaiting Confirmation (< 10)     | 0.452000000
   Locked by previous transaction   | 1200.453000000
   -------------------------------- | -------------
   Currently Spendable              | 0.000000000

   Command 'info' completed successfully
 #+end_src

- *Total* is your total amount, including any balance awaiting
  confirmation.
- *Immature Coinbase* denotes any coinbase transactions (i.e. won
  blocks by mining) that have yet to mature before they can be
  spent. For a block to mature, it has to wait for a certain number of
  blocks to be added to the chain.
- *Awaiting Confirmation* is the balance that the wallet won't spend
  until a given number of confirmations (number of blocks added to the
  chain since the block in which the transaction was confirmed). This
  defaults to 10 blocks.
- *Locked by previous transaction* are outputs locked by a previous
  send transaction, which cannot be included in further
  transactions. These will generally disappear (become spent) when the
  transaction confirms.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id miner_wallet_server
* Miner + Wallet + Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: miner_wallet_server
  :END:
Miners are responsible for processing the transactions in the
blockchain. When a batch of transactions is processed, the first one
responsible for processing it gains a reward and the fees on
those transactions. That involves both computing power and luck. 

There are three algorithms that help producing the blocks.
- [[https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW][ProgPow]]
- [[https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo][Cuckoo]]
- [[https://github.com/tevador/RandomX][RandomX]]

Based on the links shown above, you should select the algorithm that
best fits your hardware.

*To run the epic-miner you also need an epic server running and a
wallet listening*. You need the wallet listening to receive the epics
(currency) that come from the mining reward and transaction fees (if
you succeed in process a block in the network) and you need the epic
server to propagate the transactions.

Instruction of how to run you epic server can be
found on [[#run_epic][Running the Epic Server]] and the instructions of how to get
the wallet listening can be found on [[#run_wallet][Running the wallet API]].

** Prerequisites

    You can run the miner using only *CPU* or using *CPU and GPU*.
   
    To run using *CPU/GPU* in Debian-based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint,
    etc.), you will need the *OpenCL*, to install it just run the following
    command in the terminal:

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev
    #+end_src

** Installation
The following steps explain how to install and run the epic-miner:

1. Download the latest version of the epic miner:
   - To use *only CPU* download this:
     - [[https://epiccash.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/packages/epic-miner_1.0.5-1_amd64.deb][epic miner]] Checksum SHA256:ee41dba5443a1a1830e7ba1fb70c3434f74173c2a1304b8d659183b77321810f
   - To use *CPU/GPU* download this:
     - [[https://epiccash.s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/packages/epic-miner-opencl_1.0.5-1_amd64.deb][epic miner - opencl]] Checksum SHA256: 5ba08a09aae3c1ccf8ff2bddefc74f8df4048bf58f92071ff1a87c7c11c2fc19
   
2. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the directory where you
   downloaded the .deb file and execute the following command changing
   the argument <your-epic-miner.deb> to the name of your downloaded
   file:
    #+begin_src shell
      sudo dpkg -i <your-epic-miner.deb>
    #+end_src

3. You can build the miner using only *CPU*, using *CPU/GPU* and using *Nvidia*,
   check the "Build steps" section in [[https://gitlab.com/epiccash/epic-miner/blob/master/README.md][README.md]] for more information.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id config_miner_server
** Configuring the Epic Server to work with the miner
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: config_miner_server
  :END:    

To run the epic server with an epic-miner some configurations need to
be changed in the ~epic-server.toml~. Close any epic server running
(in the epic server TUI press *Q*) and open the ~epic-server.toml~
with your preferred text editor. Following, there is an example of how
to open the ~epic-server.toml~ generated by [[#epic_config_default][the default configurations]]
using the text editor vim. For this, Open the terminal and type the
command:

    #+begin_src shell
      vim ~/.epic/main/epic-server.toml
    #+end_src

Find the line:

    #+begin_src toml
      enable_stratum_server = false
    #+end_src

After that, find the lines:

  #+begin_src toml
   cuckatoo_minimum_share_difficulty = 1
   randomx_minimum_share_difficulty = 1
   progpow_minimum_share_difficulty = 1
  #+end_src

And change the line accordingly with the algorithm used to mine. Some
suggestions are: 

  #+begin_src toml
   cuckatoo_minimum_share_difficulty = 1
   randomx_minimum_share_difficulty = 800
   progpow_minimum_share_difficulty = 100
  #+end_src

Then, save and close the file. After that, you can start your [[#run_epic][epic server]].

#+ATTR_HTML: :id config_miner
** Configuring your epic-miner
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: config_miner
  :END:    

To configure your miner, open the ~epic-miner.toml~ in the folder
~/etc/~ with your text editor. The following terminal command shows how
to open this file with the vim editor.

    #+begin_src shell
      sudo vim /etc/epic-miner.toml
    #+end_src

With the ~epic-miner.toml~ opened, find the line:

    #+begin_src toml
      algorithm = "ProgPow"
    #+end_src

Changing this line you can change what algorithm you are going to use
for mining. There are 3 possible choices: ProgPow, RandomX, Cuckoo.

** Additional configuration: ProgPow

If you are going to mine with ProgPow, you will need to set some
additional parameters in the ~epic-miner.toml~. Open the
~epic-miner.toml~ with your preferred text editor and find the
following line:

    #+begin_src toml
      [[mining.gpu_config]]
      device = 0
      driver = 2
    #+end_src

The *device* parameter sets your GPU ID if you have multiple GPUS, if you only
have one, leave it with the value of 0. You may want to use device numbers in
the same PCI Bus ID enumeration order as used by non-CUDA programs. To do this
set the *CUDA_​DEVICE_​ORDER* environment variable to *PCI_BUS_ID* in your shell.
The default value of this variable is *FASTEST_FIRST*. More info on this can be
found [[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars][here]]. Note that this is available only in CUDA 7 and later.

The *driver* parameter specifies the type driver that will be used to mine with
the GPU. The value *1* corresponds to CUDA (exclusive to Nvidia GPUs) and the
value *2* corresponds to OpenCL(OCL). Following there is an example of how to
mine with the GPU (primary) using CUDA:

    #+begin_src toml
      [[mining.gpu_config]]
      device = 0
      driver = 1
    #+end_src

** Additional configuration: RandomX

If you are going to mine with RandomX, you will need to set some additional
parameters in the ~epic-miner.toml~. Open the ~epic-miner.toml~ with your
preferred text editor and find the following lines:

#+begin_src toml
[mining.randomx_config]
threads = 1
jit = false
large_pages = false
hard_aes = false
#+end_src

You can specify the desired number of threads used by the RandomX algorithm by
setting its value in the variable *threads*.


Check the [[https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/blob/master/doc/design.md][RandomX design]] in order to have a clear understanding about the value
of the variables above.

After you finish all your modification, save and close the file.

** Additional configuration: Cuckoo

If you are going to mine with Cuckoo, you will need to set some
additional parameters in the ~epic-miner.toml~. Open the
~epic-miner.toml~ with your preferred text editor and find the
following lines:

    #+begin_src toml
     [[mining.miner_plugin_config]]
     plugin_name = "cuckatoo_lean_cpu_compat_31"
     [mining.miner_plugin_config.parameters]
     nthreads = 4
    #+end_src

In *plugin_name* you can specify what type of cuckoo algorithm you
will be using. *The cuckaroo_29 is being deprecated, so the miner will
not work if you use any of its variants (cuckaroo_cpu_avx2_29,
cuckaroo_cpu_compat_29)*. To get all plugins available, execute the
following command in the terminal:

    #+begin_src shell
      ls /opt/epic-miner/bin/plugins
    #+end_src

You will get something like this as output:

    #+begin_src shell
     cuckaroo_cpu_avx2_19.cuckooplugin    cuckatoo_lean_cpu_avx2_31.cuckooplugin    cuckatoo_mean_cpu_avx2_31.cuckooplugin
     cuckaroo_cpu_compat_19.cuckooplugin  cuckatoo_lean_cpu_compat_19.cuckooplugin  cuckatoo_mean_cpu_compat_19.cuckooplugin
     cuckatoo_mean_cpu_avx2_19.cuckooplugin cuckatoo_lean_cpu_compat_31.cuckooplugin  cuckatoo_mean_cpu_compat_31.cuckooplugin
    #+end_src

Then, just put the desired plugin name without .cuckooplugin extension
in the *plugin_name* variable.

You can also specify the number of threads that a plugin will use in
the variable *nthreads*.

After you finish all your modification, save and close the file.

If you want more details about the cuckoo plugins, there are more
examples of how to use the cuckoo plugins in the ~epic-miner.toml~.

** Runing the miner

Once the [[#run_epic][epic server is running]] and your [[#run_wallet][wallet is listening]], to
execute the epic-miner open a new terminal window and execute the
following command:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-miner
    #+end_src

If you executed the epic-miner in TUI mode (the default is true in
~epic-miner.toml~), you should see a screen like this:

#+CAPTION: Epic miner in TUI mode 
#+NAME:   fig:epic-miner
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[./images/epic-miner.png]]

Press the key *Tab* or the *Arrows* keys to change windows inside the epic
miner. Press the key *Enter* to select an item. Press the key *Q* to quit the
epic miner.

In the image above, we were mining with RandomX algorithm with 3 threads in the
cpu.

More details about the epic miner stats can be found in [[#epic_miner_stats][Mining Stats]]. 

#+ATTR_HTML: :id epic_miner_stats
** Mining Stats
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: epic_miner_stats
  :END:

*Solutions Found* is the number of valid solutions you mining
algorithm has found. Note that this is not the same as finding a
block. Only solutions that pass a further difficulty check, (as tested
by the Epic server) can be used to solve a block.

*Accepted* is the number of solutions your miners found that were
accepted by the epic server as valid shares (or contributions to the
pool). Again, this does not correspond to number of solved blocks or
mining rewards.

*Rejected* is the number of rejected shares. Each block in the
epic-cash block chain has a predetermined algorithm to be mined. For
example, if you found a solution using the algorithm *A*, and the
current block has to be mined with algorithm *B*, your block will be
rejected.

*Stale* is the number of solutions that were found to late (someone
else on the network solved the block before the solution was submit).

*Blocks* found is the actual number of blocks that you've solved, in
other words, valid solutions that passed the difficulty check and were
also accepted by the network.

* Testnet Reset

During the Testnet phase, we unavoidably make modifications that break
the blockchain. Therefore, sometimes we must perform a hard reset.

A hard reset notification will be sent to the "Mining Troubleshooting"
group in Telegram.

When a hard reset happens, you need to remove the "chain_data"
directory and the ~epic-server.toml~ file:

Open a new terminal window and execute the command:

    #+begin_src shell
      rm -rf ~/.epic/main/chain_data/
    #+end_src

You also need to remove the ~epic-server.toml~. To do that, type the following command
in the terminal:

    #+begin_src shell
      rm -rf ~/.epic/main/epic-server.toml
    #+end_src
