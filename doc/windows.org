#+TITLE: Epic Cash on Windows
#+OPTIONS: ^:nil

* Introduction

This document describes how to run each of the elements of the Epic
blockchain on Windows.

There are three different cases that you can run the Epic Cash blockchain: 
- [[#server][Running only the server]].
- [[#wallet_server][Running the server and the wallet.]]
- [[#miner_wallet_server][Running the server, the wallet and the miner]].

If you want to just have a copy of the chain or help the propagation
of the blocks in the network, all you need is to run the server.

If you want to make transactions such as payments or receiving
payments, you need to run the epic server and the epic wallet.

If you want to produce new blocks and with that gain rewards (both new
coins and transactions fees), you will need to run the epic server
with an epic wallet listening to it and an epic miner.

* Supported Platforms

For now, these are the supported platforms:

- Linux x86_64 (dpkg for Ubuntu)
- MacOS (no package yet)
- Windows (precompiled binaries)

* Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: server
  :END:

The epic server is a node in the network that validates, propagates
and sometimes produces new blocks (for the latter, you need a miner),
which is a basically a collection of processed transactions. In this
section we explain how to install and setup your epic server.

** Installation

The following steps explain how to install and run the epic server:

1. Download the latest version of the *epic* server for windows [[https://epic.tech/downloads/][here]].

2. Unpack the zip file.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id run_epic
** Running the Epic Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: run_epic
  :END:
After you finished the installation, you can run it by executing the
epic.exe file.

*If you are running the epic server for the first time, it will use*
*its [[#epic_config_default][default configuration]]. If you want to save all epic server data*
*in a custom directory check the section [[#epic_config_custom][Configuring a Custom
 Directory.]]*

If you executed the epic server in Text-User-Interface mode (TUI), you
should see a screen like this:

#+CAPTION: Epic server in TUI mode 
#+NAME:   fig:epic-miner
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50% :height 50% 
[[./images/epic-server.png]]

Press the key *Tab* or the *Arrows* keys to change windows inside the epic
server. Press the key *Enter* to select an item. Press the key *Q* to
quit the epic server.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id run_config_default
** Configuring your Epic node
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: epic_config_default
  :END:

By default, the epic server keeps all of its configuration files and
data in the ~C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.epic/main~ directory. The main
server configuration file can be found in the file
~C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.epic/main/epic-server.toml~. This file is
fully documented and contains many configuration options for your Epic
server. Leaving these values at their defaults should work for most
people who simply want to run a node.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id epic_config_custom
*** Configuring a Custom Directory
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: epic_config_custom
  :END:

You can also keep Epic's data and configuration files in a custom
directory. In the terminal (cmd), navigate to the directory in which you
epic.exe is and run:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic.exe server config
    #+end_src
    
This will create an ~epic-server.toml~ file in the current directory
that is configured to place its data files in the same
directory. *The* *epic.exe will always check the current directory for
an* *~epic-server.toml~ file, and if one is found it will use it
instead of* *~C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.epic/main/epic-server.toml~.*

#+ATTR_HTML: :id wallet_server
* Wallet + Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: wallet_server
  :END:

The epic wallet is quite literally your wallet. It's where your
account's balance is stored and where you spend and receive money.

*To run the epic-wallet you also need an epic server running*. The
wallet request transactions from the epic server. The epic server is
responsible for propagating and receiving the transactions.

Instruction of how to run the epic server can be found on [[#run_epic][Running the
Epic Server]].

** Installation
The following steps explain how to install and run the epic-wallet:

1. Download the latest version of the *epic-wallet* for windows [[https://epic.tech/downloads/][here]].

2. Unpack the downloaded .zip file. Since the wallet doesn't have a
   TUI (TEXT USER INTERFACE), you will need to run it by the command
   prompt (cmd). You can found more information about how to run the
   command prompt on windows [[https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089][here]] and how to navigate between folder
   can be found [[https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands][here]].
   

#+ATTR_HTML: :id init_wallet
** Initialize the Wallet
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: init_wallet
  :END:    
Before you can use the Epic wallet, it must be initialized. This
process will initialize your wallet's database and create your secret
master seed file. For this, open the cmd and navigate to the folder
where you extracted the epic-wallet and execute the following command:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-wallet.exe init
    #+end_src
    
You will then be prompted to enter a password. This password will be
used to encrypt your master seed file, and you will need to provide
this password every time you want to use your wallet. The output
should be something like this:

    #+begin_src shell
      File /home/yeastplume/.epic/main/epic-wallet.toml configured and created
      Please enter a password for your new wallet
      Password: 
      Confirm Password: 
    #+end_src

Once this is done, your wallet seed file will be generated, and you
will be given a 24 word recovery phrase which you can use to recover
your wallet if you lose your seed file or forget the password. Write
this phrase down using a pen and paper and keep it somewhere safe,
since anyone who has this phrase can control all of your funds:

Your wallet's configuration file is located at
~C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.epic/main/epic-wallet.toml~. You can change
the default node address, default listener ports and many more options
by editing this file.

** Initializing from a Custom Directory

You can also keep epic wallet's data and configuration files in a
custom directory. In the cmd, navigate to the directory in which
you have the epic-wallet.exe and run:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-wallet.exe init -h
    #+end_src
    
This will create an ~epic-wallet.toml~ file in the current directory that
is configured to place its data files in the same directory. The
epic-wallet executable will always check the current directory for a
~epic-wallet.toml~ file, and if one is found it will use it instead of
~C:/Users/<YOUR_USERNAME>/.epic/main/epic-wallet.toml~.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id run_wallet
** Running the wallet API
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: run_wallet
  :END:
Once you have initialized the wallet, we need to execute it in listen
mode to be able to make transactions. With your [[#run_epic][epic server running]],
to execute the epic-wallet in listen mode, run the following command
in the cmd:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-wallet.exe -e listen
    #+end_src

You will be prompted to enter your wallet password. After you have
inserted it, the wallet will start to listen for requests.

** Check the wallet balance

To check your contents of your wallet, use the info command:

 #+begin_src shell
   epic-wallet.exe info
 #+end_src

You should see an output like this:

 #+begin_src shell 
   ____ Wallet Summary Info - Account 'default' as of height 13833 ____

   Total                            | 60.482000000
   Immature Coinbase (< 1440)       | 60.030000000
   Awaiting Confirmation (< 10)     | 0.452000000
   Locked by previous transaction   | 1200.453000000
   -------------------------------- | -------------
   Currently Spendable              | 0.000000000

   Command 'info' completed successfully
 #+end_src

- *Total* is your total amount, including any balance awaiting
  confirmation.
- *Immature Coinbase* denotes any coinbase transactions (i.e. won
  blocks by mining) that have yet to mature before they can be
  spent. For a block to mature, it has to wait for a certain number of
  blocks to be added to the chain.
- *Awaiting Confirmation* is the balance that the wallet won't spend
  until a given number of confirmations (number of blocks added to the
  chain since the block in which the transaction was confirmed). This
  defaults to 10 blocks.
- *Locked by previous transaction* are outputs locked by a previous
  send transaction, which cannot be included in further
  transactions. These will generally disappear (become spent) when the
  transaction confirms.

#+ATTR_HTML: :id miner_wallet_server
* Miner + Wallet + Server
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: miner_wallet_server
  :END:
  Miners are responsible for processing the transactions in the
  blockchain. When a batch of transactions is processed, the first one
  responsible for processing it gains a reward and the fees on
  those transactions. That involves both computing power and luck. 

  There are three algorithms that help producing the blocks.
  - [[https://github.com/tevador/RandomX][RandomX]]
  - [[https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW][ProgPow]]
  - [[https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo][Cuckoo]] (CuckAToo31+)

** RandomX
 
  *RandomX* is a Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm optimized for general
  purpose *CPUs*. It uses randomized program executions with several
  memory-hard techniques to achieve the following goals:

  - Prevention of the development of single-chip ASICs;  
  - Minimize the efficiency advantage of specialized hardware over
    general purpose CPUs.

  Mining Epic with CPUs requires a contiguous allocation of 2
  GB of physical RAM, 16 KB of L1 cache, 256 KB of L2 cache, and 2 MB
  of L3 cache per mining thread. Windows 10 devices require 8 GB or
  more RAM.

** ProgPow

  *Programmatic Proof-of-Work (ProgPow)* is an algorithm that depends on
  memory bandwidth and core computation of randomized math sequences,
  which take advantage of many of a *GPU’s* computing features and
  thereby efficiently capture the total energy cost of the
  hardware. As ProgPow is specifically designed to take full advantage
  of commodity GPUs, it is both difficult and expensive to achieve
  significantly higher efficiencies through specialized hardware.

** Cuckoo (CuckAToo31+)

  *CuckAToo31+* is an ASIC friendly permutation of the *Cuckoo Cycle*
  algorithm developed by Dutch computer scientist, John Tromp. A
  relative of the ASIC resistant CuckARoo29, CuckAToo31+ generates
  random bipartite graphs and presents miners with the task of finding a
  loop of given length ‘N’ passing through the vertices of that graph.

  This is a memory bound task, meaning the solution time is bound by
  memory bandwidth rather than raw processor or GPU speed. As a
  result, the Cuckoo Cycle algorithms produce less heat and consume
  significantly less energy than traditional PoW algorithms. The ASIC
  friendly CuckAToo31+ allows efficiency improvements over GPUs by
  using hundreds of MB of SRAM while remaining bottlenecked by memory
  I/O. *Although, CuckAToo is intended to be mined by ASICs in the
  future, it can also be mined well using 11GB+ GPUs.*


** Prerequisites

   *To run the epic-miner you also need an epic server running and a
   wallet listening*. You need the wallet listening to receive the epics
   (currency) that come from the mining reward and transaction fees (if
   you succeed in process a block in the network) and you need the epic
   server to propagate the transactions.

   Instruction of how to run you epic server can be
   found on [[#run_epic][Running the Epic Server]] and the instructions of how to get
   the wallet listening can be found on [[#run_wallet][Running the wallet API]].


**  Prerequisites - GPU mining

    If you are planning to mine using GPU (ProgPow and CuckAToo31+),
    there are two possible ways, mine with [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL][OPENCL]] or [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA][CUDA]]. The main
    difference between CUDA and OpenCL is that CUDA is a proprietary
    framework created by Nvidia (working only with NVIDIA GPUs) and
    OpenCL is open source (working with AMD GPUs, NVIDIA GPUs and a
    series of other hardware). The general consensus is that if you
    have NVIDIA GPUs (that supports both CUDA and OpenCL), go with
    CUDA as it will generate better performance results. More
    information regarding this can be found [[https://create.pro/blog/opencl-vs-cuda/][here]]. The CUDA executable
    is currently not available for the windows.
     
** Installation

   There are two different versions of the epic-miner executable for
   windows:

     - If you want to mine using *only CPU* (basically RandomX) there
       is the executable called *epic-miner*
     - If you want to mine using *GPU with OPENCL* there is the
       package called *epic-miner-opencl*

   The following steps explain how to install and run the epic-miner.

   1. Download the latest version of the desired *epic-miner* executable
      [[https://epic.tech/downloads/][here]]:

   2. Extract the downloaded .zip file.


#+ATTR_HTML: :id config_miner
** Configuring your epic-miner
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: config_miner
  :END:    

To configure your miner, open the ~epic-miner.toml~ in the folder
where you extracted the epic-miner files with a text editor. 

With the ~epic-miner.toml~ opened, find the line:

    #+begin_src toml
      algorithm = "ProgPow"
    #+end_src

Changing this line you can change what algorithm you are going to use
for mining. There are 3 possible choices: ProgPow, RandomX, Cuckoo.

** Additional configuration: ProgPow

If you are going to mine with ProgPow, you will need to set some
additional parameters in the ~epic-miner.toml~. Open the
~epic-miner.toml~ with your preferred text editor and find the
following line:

    #+begin_src toml
      [[mining.gpu_config]]
      device = 0
      driver = 2
    #+end_src

The *device* parameter sets your GPU ID if you have multiple GPUS, if
you only have one, leave it with the value of 0. You may want to use
device numbers in the same PCI Bus ID enumeration order as used by
non-CUDA programs. To do this set the *CUDA_​DEVICE_​ORDER* environment
variable to *PCI_BUS_ID* in your shell.  The default value of this
variable is *FASTEST_FIRST*. More info on this can be found [[https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars][here]]. Note
that this is available only in CUDA 7 and later.

The *driver* parameter specifies the type of the driver that will be
used to mine with the GPU. The value *1* corresponds to CUDA
(exclusive to Nvidia GPUs) and the value *2* corresponds to
OpenCL(OCL). Following there is an example of how to mine with the GPU
(primary) using CUDA:

    #+begin_src toml
      [[mining.gpu_config]]
      device = 0
      driver = 1
    #+end_src

*** Multi-GPU Mining

If you want to mine using multiple GPUs just copy and paste the lines
shown in the section Additional configuration: ProgPow, changing the
*device* parameter to match your GPUs ID and the type of driver that
will be used in each one with the parameter *driver*. Following there
is an example of how to mine with the 2 GPUs (NVIDIA) using CUDA:

    #+begin_src toml
      [[mining.gpu_config]]
      device = 0
      driver = 1

      [[mining.gpu_config]]
      device = 1
      driver = 1
    #+end_src

** Additional configuration: RandomX

If you are going to mine with RandomX, you will need to set some additional
parameters in the ~epic-miner.toml~. Open the ~epic-miner.toml~ with your
preferred text editor and find the following lines:

#+begin_src toml
[mining.randomx_config]
threads = 1
jit = false
large_pages = false
hard_aes = false
#+end_src

You can specify the desired number of threads used by the RandomX algorithm by
setting its value in the variable *threads*.


Check the [[https://github.com/tevador/RandomX/blob/master/doc/design.md][RandomX design]] in order to have a clear understanding about the value
of the variables above.

After you finish all your modification, save and close the file.

** Additional configuration: Cuckoo

If you are going to mine with Cuckoo, you will need to set some
additional parameters in the ~epic-miner.toml~. Open the
~epic-miner.toml~ with your preferred text editor and find the
following lines:

    #+begin_src toml
     [[mining.miner_plugin_config]]
     plugin_name = "cuckatoo_lean_cpu_compat_31"
     [mining.miner_plugin_config.parameters]
     nthreads = 4
    #+end_src

In *plugin_name* you can specify what type of cuckoo algorithm you
will be using. *The cuckaroo_29 is being deprecated, so the miner will
not work if you use any of its variants (cuckaroo_cpu_avx2_29,
cuckaroo_cpu_compat_29)*. To get all plugins available navigate to the
folder ./plugins in the folder where you extracted your epic miner files:

Then, just put the desired plugin name without .cuckooplugin extension
in the *plugin_name* variable.

You can also specify the number of threads that a plugin will use in
the variable *nthreads*.

After you finish all your modification, save and close the file.

If you want more details about the cuckoo plugins, there are more
examples of how to use the cuckoo plugins in the ~epic-miner.toml~.

** Runing the miner

Once the [[#run_epic][epic server is running]] and your [[#run_wallet][wallet is listening]], to
execute the epic-miner open a new terminal window and execute the
following command:

    #+begin_src shell
      epic-miner.exe
    #+end_src

If you executed the epic-miner in TUI mode (the default is true in
~epic-miner.toml~), you should see a screen like this:

#+CAPTION: Epic miner in TUI mode 
#+NAME:   fig:epic-miner
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%
[[./images/epic-miner.png]]

Press the key *Tab* or the *Arrows* keys to change windows inside the epic
miner. Press the key *Enter* to select an item. Press the key *Q* to quit the
epic miner.

More details about the epic miner stats can be found in [[#epic_miner_stats][Mining Stats]]. 

#+ATTR_HTML: :id epic_miner_stats
** Mining Stats
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: epic_miner_stats
  :END:

*Solutions Found* is the number of valid solutions you mining
algorithm has found. Note that this is not the same as finding a
block. Only solutions that pass a further difficulty check, (as tested
by the Epic server) can be used to solve a block.

*Accepted* is the number of solutions your miners found that were
accepted by the epic server as valid shares (or contributions to the
pool). Again, this does not correspond to number of solved blocks or
mining rewards.

*Rejected* is the number of rejected shares. Each block in the
epic-cash block chain has a predetermined algorithm to be mined. For
example, if you found a solution using the algorithm *A*, and the
current block has to be mined with algorithm *B*, your block will be
rejected.

*Stale* is the number of solutions that were found to late (someone
else on the network solved the block before the solution was submit).

*Blocks* found is the actual number of blocks that you've solved, in
other words, valid solutions that passed the difficulty check and were
also accepted by the network.
